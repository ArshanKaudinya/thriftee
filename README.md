## About the Project

Thriftee is a full-stack web platform built with **Next.js**, **Supabase**, and **TailwindCSS** — designed with simplicity and speed in mind. Born from the student experience, Thriftee solves the everyday problem of unused items lying around, while helping others find affordable essentials.

This project is currently focused on student ecosystems and active thrift local communities, but it’s scalable to broader hyperlocal communities and small businesses.
